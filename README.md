# MyApp

"My app 'similarstrength' is a hobby project aimed to learn programming. The app is based on Java and utilizes Spring Boot to communicate with the database. A unique feature of the app is that it allows users to increase or decrease the number of repetitions using the volume up and down buttons on their smartphones."

The app will be completed in 3-4 months, and useful features such as user search and analysis of strength data will be added.
